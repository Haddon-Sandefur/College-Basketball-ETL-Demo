The following output is a demo. 

The Python Files are set to run on the entire 2022 season.

The final data, "cbb_DataProcessed" contains games in the first two days of the 2022 season.

Please run files in order (For simplicity, I recommend doing this in a Spyder environment, but you can set up a batch if you'd like):
1. cbb_Pycrawl.py
2. cbb_Pyscrape_ESPN.py
3. cbb_Pyset_Edit.py

If you attempt to run files without editing the scrape dates, you may experience a timeout from ESPN's servers.
Scripts are meant to be ran on a daily or weekly basis *during* a season, so scraping everything all at once may get you kicked from ESPN's servers.
